I'm looking for a company to work for based on my years of coding experience.

I have skilled coding experiences with a Bachelor’s in Mobile Systems Engineering, BCIT Certification in Software System Developer Course. My area of expertise is to quickly find the cause of the problem and provide the corresponding solution. Also, I focus on full stack development, especially web application and mobile app development.

I'm a team player. So my favorite sport is soccer, and I have experience in various coding team projects. Most recently, I participated in an industry project and upgraded the application under development and distributed it to Testflight.
